django-mercadopago
==================

**django-mercadopago** is a django application for interacting with
MercadoPago[mercadopago].

While somewhat incomplete, it's under heavy development since it's to be used
in a soon-to-be-released product.

Features
--------

Our intention is not to cover 100% of the features of the upstream API, but
rather provide a simple app that allows accepting and tracking payments. This
should suffice for simple sites like shopping carts, online sales, etc.

Pull requests are always welcome. Please don't hesitate to open an issue if you
encounter a problem. New features will generally only be added as needed, but
again, accepted if you submit a patch.
